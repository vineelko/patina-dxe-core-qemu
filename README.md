# QEMU DXE Core Binaries

## Overview

The main purpose of this repository is to integrate the Rust components and dependencies necessary to build a Rust
DXE Core binary that will be used in QEMU firmware.

Currently, two QEMU platforms are supported, Q35 for x64 architecture and SBSA for aarch64 architecture.

To build, use the same environment as the [patina](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina) build and execute the following steps:

1) Set the RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP environment variable to 1
   - Linux: `export RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1`
   - Windows (cmd): `set RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1`
   - Windows (powershell): `$env:RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1`

2) Execute cargo make, specifying the target project
   - Q35 debug: `cargo make q35`
   - Q35 release: `cargo make q35-release`
   - SBSA debug: `cargo make sbsa`
   - SBSA release: `cargo make sbsa-release`
 
3) The binaries will be located in the target directory
   - Q35 debug: `target/x86_64-unknown-uefi/debug/qemu_q35_dxe_core.efi`
   - Q35 release: `target/x86_64-unknown-uefi/release/qemu_q35_dxe_core.efi`
   - SBSA debug: `target/aarch64-unknown-uefi/debug/qemu_q35_dxe_core.efi`
   - SBSA release: `target/aarch64-unknown-uefi/release/qemu_q35_dxe_core.efi`

The resulting .EFI file is a direct replacement for the dxe core driver in the [patina-qemu](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-qemu) UEFI build

## Working with Local Dependencies

In your development workflow, you should test your firmware changes on QEMU. You can replace the dependencies in this
repo with your local repo for each dependency to build and test that code.

To do that, follow the [Overriding Dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html)
section in the Cargo Book. Notice that although the `crates-io` registry is replaced with the `UefiRust` in our repo
in `.cargo/config.toml`, the `crates-io` registry is still patched here similar to the examples in the Cargo Book.

```toml
adv_logger = { version = "7" }
dxe_core = { version = "7" }
log = { version = "^0.4", default-features = false, features = [
    "release_max_level_warn",
] }
sample_components = { version = "7" }
section_extractor = { version = "9" }
uefi_cpu = { version = "9" }
uefi_debugger = { version = "9" }
uefi_sdk = { version = "1" }
```

To produce the following temporary contents in the `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
adv_logger = { version = "7" }
dxe_core = { version = "7" }
log = { version = "^0.4", default-features = false, features = [
    "release_max_level_warn",
] }
sample_components = { version = "7" }
section_extractor = { version = "9" }
uefi_cpu = { version = "9" }
uefi_debugger = { version = "9" }
uefi_sdk = { version = "1" }

[patch.crates-io]
dxe_core = { path = "../uefi-dxe-core/dxe_core" }
```

## NuGet Publishing Instructions

The NuGet package is currently published to the public [Patina QEMU DXE Core](https://dev.azure.com/patina-fw/artifacts/_artifacts/feed/qemu-dxe-core)
feed where it is consumed in the [Patina QEMU](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-qemu) repository.

The NuGet is built and published using a GitHub workflow in [Patina QEMU DXE Core Actions](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-dxe-core-qemu/actions).
